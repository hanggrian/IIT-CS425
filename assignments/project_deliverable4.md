# [Project Deliverable 4](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-CS425/raw/assets/assignments/project.pdf): CTA

> The last deliverable requires to write a program in any programming language
  SQL supports and implement a variety of SQL commands.

## Problem 1

> The application can either be web or desktop application and must be
  demonstrated on the due date.

## Problem 2

> Extra points will be awarded to a group that tests a variety of challenging
  SQL usage (such as set operations, aggregate functions, set membership, set
  comparison, subqueries using WITH clause, etc.).

## Problem 3

> Further, interesting use cases that can be evaluated with sample queries will
  earn extra points.
